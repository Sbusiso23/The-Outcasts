Eyelashes on fleek, check!
15	Inches, check!
Flat stomach; big buttocks and gigantic breasts
Therefore hourglass body, Check!
Either than that, you are out!
Or if you are a really slim, you are an exception.
Model type, extremely attractive, slim body Check
Either than that
You don’t qualify, standard beauty is a category you don’t fall under girl, so bye!


Dang! What does that mean?
I have no intention of learning how to draw an eyebrow
I am so comfortable with these bushy eyelashes
Oh my body!
This pot belly, buttocks nothing, straight as a ruler!
Don’t mention the face please,
My face does not even qualify in the first group of ugly people, so people say 
Oh no!
No man will ever look at me
What does that mean? 
A woman has to be beautiful, what can I do? 
I can put on make-up, but I hate it 
Nobody wants an ugly person 
You watch movies, music videos
There is no one of my calibre
People never forget to remind you how ugly you are!
‘Embarrassed to know you, especially around people who are beautiful’
‘Make very upsetting jokes around the boys they like’
To wrap it up, you are always the joke.


You know what,
It doesn’t matter!
I can be whoever I want to be, I should not be bitter with people who were gifted with beauty
Let them use the gift they have to survive.
Surviving is every Homo sapien’s way of life 
Mainly atleast
Let them enjoy their blessings
I can be happy with the very things I enjoy 
Love those who love me 
I mean at the end of the day my everyday life is what completes me 
People who love you 
Never even think of your outer beauty
